It was given its botanical name, Solanum tuberosum, in 1596 by the Swiss botanist Gaspard Bauhin, and belongs to the Solanaceae family, the nightshades, which includes eggplant, peppers, and the tomato. Growing wild as early as 13,000 years ago on the Chilean coast of South America , potatoes were first cultivated by farmers in the Andes Mountains nearly seven thousand years ago. Nutritionally, the potato supplies complex carbohydrates든ssential for energy드nd a very low amount (about 10 percent) of protein. One serving (a 5.3-ounce medium potato) provides: 45 percent of Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) for vitamin C (most of it in the millimeters-thick layer immediately under the skin), 21 percent of potassium, 3 grams of fiber, essentially no fat, and only 100 calories. It is rich in the minerals iron and magnesium and supplies all the vital nutrients except calcium and vitamins A and D. Potatoes are the vegetable eaten most frequently in the United States , and the one ordered most when Americans eat out. In 2001, the average American ate 41 pounds of potatoes. Interestingly, consumption again peaked among those between thirteen and seventeen (83.2 pounds) and six to twelve (85.5 pounds), who presumably consume most of their potatoes as french fries, chips, and novelty forms. The United States ranks fourth in world potato production, with an estimated 1.26 million acres planted in 2001. With a world harvest of 291 million tons grown in more than 100 countries, potatoes are second only to rice as a world food crop.
POTATO. (The sweet potato is not a potato; it belongs to the morning glory family.) Growing wild as early as 13,000 years ago on the Chilean coast of South America , potatoes were first cultivated by farmers in the Andes Mountains nearly seven thousand years ago. Nutritionally, the potato supplies complex carbohydrates든ssential for energy드nd a very low amount (about 10 percent) of protein. It is rich in the minerals iron and magnesium and supplies all the vital nutrients except calcium and vitamins A and D. In 2001, the average American ate 41 pounds of potatoes. In 1996, the annual per capita consumption increased with age among those over eighteen: between eighteen and thirty-four, 74.3 pounds; thirty-five to forty-four, 80.6; forty-five to fifty-four, 87.4; fifty-five to sixty-four, 88.9; and, for those sixty-five and older, 109 pounds. Interestingly, consumption again peaked among those between thirteen and seventeen (83.2 pounds) and six to twelve (85.5 pounds), who presumably consume most of their potatoes as french fries, chips, and novelty forms. The United States ranks fourth in world potato production, with an estimated 1.26 million acres planted in 2001. Russia is the largest producer.
